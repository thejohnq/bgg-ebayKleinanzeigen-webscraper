# BoardGameGeek Ebay Kleinanzeigen WebScraper
this small webscraper helps finding games of your BoardGameGeek wishlist on ebay kleinanzeigen.

## How-To
just write your bgg username in line as bgg_username. optionaly you can add or remove split chars. these are the characters that end a board game title, i.e. "Chronicles of Crime: The Millennium Series – Chronicles of Time Expansion" would be "Chronicles of Crime: The Millennium Series" because of the "–" split character.
when you run the code you will be asked for how many days in the past you are looking for - default is just today (=0).
